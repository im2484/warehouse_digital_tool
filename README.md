# Warehouse Data Visualization Tool [Franklin, NJ]

Note: This digital tool is in active development and is subject to modifications. 

This is a digital project compiled with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This tool visualizes confirmed and constructed warehouse projects in Franklin, NJ. Originally compiled as part of a documentary project with the Princeton VizE Lab, it can feature interactive graphics and data tables to provide residents with pertinent information and potential resources.

Presently, this tool generates a 3D model of warehouse square footage in Franklin Township, NJ. It proceeds to outline land parcels designated for warehouse use before arriving at an Amazon warehouse project and comparing it side-by-side to the Empire State Building.
